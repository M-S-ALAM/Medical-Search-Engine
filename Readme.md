# Medical word embedding and search engine

## Business Context:
We all must have wondered that if we search for a particular word in google, it does
not show just the results that contain the very same word but also shows results that
are very closely related to it. For example, if we search for the term ‘medicine’ in
google, you can see results that not just include the word ‘medicine’ but also terms
such as ‘health,’ ‘pharmacy’, ‘WHO’ and so on. So, google somehow understands
that these terms are closely related to each other. This is where word embeddings
come into the picture. Word embeddings are nothing but numerical representations
of words in a sentence depending on the context. In this project, we will be learning
how word embeddings work and how can we build a smart search engine,
particularly for medical science using word embeddings.
## Aim :
To develop a machine learning application that can understand the relationship and
pattern between various words used together in the field of medical science, create a
smart search engine for records containing those terms, and finally build a machine
learning pipeline in azure to deploy and scale the application
